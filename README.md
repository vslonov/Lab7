# Lab7

This repository contains a recreation of Lab 5 done through make. The script takes an input file, in this case the unsorted collection of Pokemon information, removes excess data aside from the names of the Pokemon, and finally sorts them in alphabetical order. The first line creates a file that has just the names but is unsorted, and deletes it after sorting into the final file.

The 'make' command allows the creation of the file that is used to carry out the script. This is done at the beginning of the session because the command would have nothing to run without it. 

The 'make clean' command is used after everything is finished to make sure there are no temporary files that can slow down the system after everything has been processed.
